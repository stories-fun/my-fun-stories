          I started writing this book while I was in India and a large part of
          it was conceptualized and written in India. Parts of the book have
          been conceived and/or written through my stay in Paris, Amsterdam,
          Luxembourg, Qatar, UAE, Singapore, Brussels and Berlin. However, the
          words you are reading right now(and certain other sections of the
          book) are being written (almost totally by chance!)in a rather
          interesting place - a Cafe named after a man who married his own
          cousin, never saw his first daughter, if he ever went to an Indian
          school, 5th grade bullies would call him &quot;Maggi noodles&quot;
          over his now iconic hairdo, he refused the Presidency of Israel, was
          spied on by the FBI for decades and on the side, also made some
          scientific discoveries - I&apos;m of course talking about Albert
          Einstein.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The cafe is called - (take a wild guess) - Cafe Einstein! I mean, I
          would have hoped they were more imaginative than that? For egs, I
          would perhaps have called it Cafe Spooky Einstein or Cafe
          Einstainglement(Sounds so German no?) in reference to his dismissive
          remark on the remarkable concept of &quot;Quantum Entanglement&quot;
          in Quantum Physics.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          I feel one subject that comes closest to life is Quantum Physics. If
          you truly want to &quot;understand&quot; life, you must
          &quot;understand&quot; Quantum Physics but there is a problem - you
          cannot. Quantum Physics cannot be understood - you must keep trying
          until some day, you just get it. In Quantum Physics, there is a
          beautiful concept called Quantum Entanglement which basically suggests
          that the state of one particle has a direct impact on the state of a
          totally different particle. Confused? Let me explain using a Bollywood
          movie.

          There is a Bollywood classic from the &apos;90s called
          &quot;Judwaa&quot; (meaning &quot;Twins&quot; in English). The lead
          star Salman Khan went on to become one of the biggest and most
          controversial film stars in India and this movie played a huge role in
          it. It&apos;s also funny how Salman came about doing this movie. The
          then reigning Bollywood superstar Govinda was initially cast for the
          movie and had even started shooting for it. One night, at roughly 2 am
          or so, he receives a call from Salman saying &quot;How many hits will
          you give Chichi Bhaiya? Keep some for us also&quot; and after that
          call, Govinda handed over the movie to Salman. That&apos;s it. It is
          ridiculous how much impact a perfectly crafted sentence can have on
          you.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Now in the movie Judwaa, a pair of identical twins separated at birth
          grow up with totally contrasting upbringing. One grows on to become a
          sophisticated, rich suave man and the other an uncouth street goon. In
          the climax, the goon is tragically locked up in with his loving and
          obedient sidekick and unable to fight while his twin who had perhaps
          never killed a mosquito his entire life, must now confront a menacing
          villain who he must defeat in order to save his brother and rest of
          his family. What happens next? The twin locked up in jail starts
          beating up his sacrificial sidekick and guess what?! - in what is
          possibly the earliest demonstration of Quantum Entanglement, his
          twin&apos;s body miraculously responds in the exact same manner as his
          brother and he ends up beating the villain! Whosoever said that one
          must leave their brains behind to watch a Bollywood movie was clearly
          wrong. Einstein found this(this as in Quantum Entanglement and not the
          movie of course) too ridiculous to be true and called it &quot;spooky
          action at a distance&quot;. Life is so strange, no?

          The Cafe is not named Einstein without reason though. The Cafe is
          located right below the apartment where Einstein lived with his
          (first) wife and son and more significantly, it is where he developed
          and wrote the &quot;Theory of Relativity&quot; that as we now know has
          changed the course of modern day physics and our understanding of the
          cosmos. Not a bad place to write a book on God(and crypto, given

          Now, why is the book titled &quot;How I Met God & Got into

          indeed talk about what the title promises - and much more. Now, I know
          the title sounds ridiculous. If somebody told me this 10 years ago, I
          would have laughed in disbelief too. In fact, as I rewrite this
          preface, I still laugh. My views on religion and God is best reflected

          I must now address a standard question and quickly get it out of the
          way - &quot;Why should you read this book&quot;.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This book at its core is about how I found my purpose in life - which
          involves God & Crypto. Through my journey initially, I thought or was
          rather made to believe that purpose is something we make up - to make
          our life more meaningful and that life itself has no purpose and
          that&apos;s when I came to know about a beautiful & forgotten Indian
          life principle which I believe is long due for revival.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Before I get to what the concept is, let&apos;s discuss a rather cute
          idea that has gained immense popularity in the world these days -
          Ikigai. For those unaware, Ikigai, a Japanese concept of life,
          literally translates to &quot;reason for being&quot;, recommends a
          sort of formula for living a life of purpose. The guideline it offers
          is to find one&apos;s purpose is to narrow down on that one thing that
          - you love (your passion), the world needs (your mission), you are
          good at (your vocation), and you can get paid for (your profession).
          Simple, right? Exactly! This is exactly the problem with Ikigai, that
          it is way too simple to be practical for something much more nuanced
          and enormous such as life.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Of course, it&apos;s a no-brainer - everybody would love to do
          something they love, that others need, that they are good at and then
          also make money from it! But the problem with it is two fold:
        </p>

        <ol className="mb-4 list-decimal pl-8">
          <li className="mb-2">
            It is highly impractical. Just by sheer probability and market
            economics there are only so many skill-sets in the world that would
            fit into these buckets and thereby only a few people could, at
            least, on paper, lead a purposeful life. What about the others?
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            It relies heavily upon what you do on the outside - in terms of your
            worldly activity without any consideration for how you feel within
            yourself.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            The bigger problem is this - let&apos;s say you end up finding your
            Ikigai - now that your passion is also your means of income, for how
            long would you continue to remain passionate about it? If your
            passion now has the added pressure of paying your bills, would you
            be able to do it as passionately and freely?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p className="mb-6">
          What&apos;s the solution then? This is where this book comes into the
          picture. For this coming paragraph, let&apos;s act all cool and fancy
          and deep and stuff ok then get back to business.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          In the Indian context, what one does for a living - known as artha -
          is separate from one&apos;s purpose and this brings us to the core
          theme of our book, to - Swadharma - loosely put - the sheer purpose of
          your existence. What is Swadharma exactly? You know, I get asked often
          how my life has changed since my &quot;spiritual journey&quot; or as I
          prefer calling it - &quot;Cosmic Bigg Brother&quot;(or Bigg Boss
          depending on which part of the world you live in)- as in you know,
          living in monasteries, meeting so many &quot;Gurus&quot; and
          &quot;spiritually evolved&quot; beings and yogis and monks, and all
          the spiritual practices, yoga, meditation etc - and my answer always
          baffles people - the bewilderment in their face is too conspicuous to
          miss - always - I simply tell them that &quot;I am now a better
          actor&quot; What is this even supposed to mean? The most significant
          discovery of my life that shook the foundations of my existence is the
          realization that who I am is different from the role I play(which I
          assumed to be myself all my life until that moment!). And every great
          act involves three core aspects - Knowing who you are, Knowing what
          your role is, and Knowing when to get off your role. Unfortunately,
          most people don&apos;t live with this sense of distinction between who
          they are and what their role is and end up suffering their role (and
          in extreme cases, killing themselves like Heath Ledger). Your
          Swadharma is essentially the unique role you and only you are here to
          play and are expected to play with perfection. Knowing your Swadharma
          is only one part of the job, the other and equally important part is
          how you perform your Swadharama - like an act and nothing more or less
          - without getting entangled and carried away with it - and that is why
          knowing who you are and being in touch with yourself is so crucial.
          Now the grand question is how do we know who we are, how do we be in
          touch with it, and how do we know what our role in this cosmic drama
          is? That&apos;s why this book, silly! I open my life up to you, for
          you. We&apos;re all eventually passengers in this grand journey -
          adventurers chartering unknown territories. Here I am just doing my
          bit for my fellow travelers making it a little easier for them just as
          those before me have made it easier for me! This entire book is
          essentially about how I discovered this lost principle, what it is,
          and how I arrived at my purpose - my Swadharma - which involves God &
          Crypto - two of the most crucial and misunderstood subjects of our
          time.

          I did this interesting exercise with my friends at the time of writing
          this book. I reached out to some of them to describe me in a few
          lines. There was one that particularly caught my attention and till
          date I don&apos;t know why this friend said what he did but there was
          something striking about it. There are times in my life, I have
          observed that while words may be coming out from a particular person,
          it is not them who is speaking. There is a strange and inexplicable
          wisdom flowing through them. Via them. From a rather strange source.
          This was one of those moments. He said &quot;You are the guinea pig
          that has to go through experiences that others can learn from&quot;
          There! Quantum Entanglement! I feel my life&apos;s story could have an

          You can count me as that one geeky friend in your circle who
          doesn&apos;t shy from going deep into the rabbit hole of a subject so
          that you don&apos;t necessarily have to. Imagine when the internet
          came out in the &apos;90s, or Bitcoin, in the early 2012 or AI in 2023
          - you keep hearing about these things but just don&apos;t know where
          to start so you reach out to this geeky friend of yours who gives you
          the perfect orientation so that you can then go on and explore the
          rest by yourself. This is that kind of book. I love going into rabbit
          holes! My venture into the rabbit hole of Capitalism and
          Entrepreneurship led me to being listed as one of India&apos;s Top
          Student Entrepreneurs at the age of 19. The rabbit hole of
          storytelling would lead me to creating crowdfunding history on
          Kickstarter and then publishing a bestseller that is now being adapted
          into a Global OTT show. My venture into the state of the global
          education system would help me find some dramatic insights eventually
          leading to a TEDx talk that would be watched by over 4M people
          globally. This book is about me entering the Rabbit holes of God &
          Crypto.

      <section className="mb-12">
        <p className="mb-4">
          The book is essentially a two volume adventure. An eternal conflict of
          Man vs God, Material vs Spiritual. Volume 1 is essentially about Man -
          me, my journey, and my early exploits in the material world and how it
          leads me to the doorstep of a strange new mystical world which we will
          look at more deeply in Volume 2. Volume 2 is less about me. It&apos;s
          about my stay in the monastery - It&apos;s about God, Spirituality &
          the Cosmos. Volume 2 is an audacious and unprecedented endeavour. Most
          spiritual books in the past have always been mostly about how the
          writer, a usually flawless person, is such a great spiritual figure
          and should you want to become like them, you should do what they did
          too. Such books do a great disservice to the reader - apart from a
          sense of lopsided worship and admiration towards the writer, nothing
          much comes out of it for the reader. Volume 2 of How I Met God & Got
          Into Crypto will make you an absolute geek about this world of God &
          Spirituality it will acquaint you with the why, how, and what of
          everything. Now that we would have dabbled into both worlds - via my
          internal conflict, it will also address for once the eternal conflict
          - the grand climax - what is the ultimate purpose of life, God or
          Material success? Is this world better or that? Everything you read in
          Vol 1 and 2 will then come together in a big way.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Volume 1 may appear Autobiographical but it is not an Autobiography.
          I&apos;ve only mentioned those details from my life that add up later
          to the core theme of the book! Humans are compulsive consumers of
          stories. From college gossip to Instagram Reels, today, we consume
          more stories than we ever did. If author Yuval Noah Harari is to be
          believed, stories have played an unmissable and crucial role in the
          evolution of man(and woman of course). If you put food on the table of
          a hungry man, he will start praying to a God of your choice but if you
          feed him the right story, he will start praying to you. Now, this is
          essentially a story book. A real story. It is in fact a graphic novel.
          When I first started writing the book, I had an extremely talented
          collaborator working on the illustrations. I told her on the first day
          of her job that there could arise a time in the future when she may
          want to leave the project and when that day comes, she should be
          aware. After working for almost a year and completing 40% of the work,
          she left along with all her illustrations. And in what could be one of
          the most epic promotions of all time, Lekha, who was then just a
          gifted intern, took over as the chief illustrator, almost overnight.

          In order to make it an active experience and not just a story - there
          are two things we&apos;ve done after every chapter - to give you an OG
          crypto experience, we&apos;ve added a QR code after every chapter -
          one you can scan only after completing each chapter (no cheating
          please) which will give you some free in-house $GIC tokens(We&apos;ve
          created our own cryptocurrency for the book, how cool is that?!). You
          can use these $GIC tokens to access exclusive bonus content from the
          book and much more.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          For the other theme of the book, we&apos;ve given a few blank pages
          after every chapter which you can use as a personal diary so that Vol
          1 also becomes an introspective journey for yourself. I hope I have
          satisfactorily addressed why you should be reading this book. Now
          &quot;Why am I writing this book?&quot;. Well, so that I can
          disappear. There is a deep desire in me to share my life with you and
          I first explored Social Media as a potential medium to do so but
          Social Media just lacks the depth and profundity that a book offers. I
          want this book to be an extremely intimate affair between you and me.
          Because when I am writing this book, I am lost in talking to you and I
          hope you can be lost in my world too. This book will relieve me of the
          burden of having to speak unnecessarily anywhere else because
          everything I want to say in some way will be in these two volumes. So
          maybe after publishing these books and later, actively promoting it
          for a while, I would love to simply disappear and I cannot wait for
          that day.

          Lastly, I feel I must end with a word of caution now that you are
          going to be hanging out with me over the next few days. Since
          childhood, It is usual for my friends to fall into trouble because of
          me. Many of my friends have fallen into great trouble not because they
          did something wrong. In their conduct, they were all angel-like Their
          only mistake is that they were friends with me. I was what in India we
          say a &quot;Gone case&quot;. When you hopelessly give up on someone,
          you call them a &quot;Gone Case&quot;. Over the years I had been
          scolded and beaten by my teachers so much that I developed a thick
          skin for it but once a teacher came up with an innovative way to
          embarrass me. My childhood friend and I were sitting for a Physics
          class. It couldn&apos;t hold my attention beyond some time so I
          cracked a silly joke and everyone including my bestfriend laughed. To
          everyone&apos;s surprise, my teacher picks on him and not me and
          reprimands him in front of the entire class for something he clearly
          hadn&apos;t done. When my friend protested and insisted that it was me
          who had made the joke and that she was mistaken, the teacher replied
          that &quot;Adhitya is a Gone Case, we all know that. There is no point
          telling him anything. It is your mistake that you sit next to
          him&quot;.

          On 17th of August 2016, my TEDx talk on &quot;The Interesting Story of
          our Educational system&quot; was published. While many across the
          globe have seen the talk, not many know the story behind it. Late in
          2015, I published my book on the fascinating story of what could well
          be India&apos;s fifth biggest religion - Engineering. The book, titled
          The Great Indian Obsession went on to become a bestseller.

        <p className="mb-4">
          By the time I had published the book I also had become a habitual
          drinker. It was mainly because I just enjoyed drinking and partly
          because the tragic findings from my first book on the broken state of
          India&apos;s education system had left me disillusioned. Pretty much
          for 3 years of my life I drank everyday - I used to consume the
          equivalent of at least 3-4 pints of beer a day. The experience of
          alcohol feels significantly enhanced with nicotine in the bloodstream
          so with that, I also smoked around 10-15 cigarettes a day. I can say
          now that I was pretty much drinking and smoking away my life and just
          then a girl decided to read my book.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Like many women around the world, this girl grew up with a
          disturbingly negative image of her body that would leave a few scars
          on her personality. By the time she entered final year of engineering
          college, with unwavering discipline and grit, she had chiseled her way
          into what my MTV Generation would call a &quot;Hot and Sexy&quot;
          college babe. Abnormally tempramental, she was also exceptionally
          smart and sort of a financial wiz kid. Even with a degree in
          Technology, she later managed to secure a banking job with the
          world&apos;s biggest Investment Bank. You may find it surprising but
          in India, Engineers are interested in doing everything but Engineering
          so it is not unusual that they become Consultants, Musicians,
          Marketing Professionals, Bakers, Writers and even Doctors and Lawyers!
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          So, this girl read my book and fell in love with it. More
          significantly, she also fell in love with the author. I fell in love
          with her too but those days I was also hopelessly in love with
          alcohol. There were very few things I cherished more than the sound of
          gulping a chilled good glass of beer down my throat soothing its
          blessed way down to the belly. Ah! So obviously I sought its
          intoxicating company everyday.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Now, this girl was the founding Chairperson of a local TEDx chapter.
          TEDx, as you may know, is a globally renowned platform for people of
          some accomplishment to exchange ideas and inspire others. She insisted
          I participate as a speaker in the upcoming edition. I wasn&apos;t keen
          because what better do you expect of a man drowned in the enchanting
          grip of Beauty and Beer? But women usually always have their way with
          me so I eventually conceded. By now, through my years in school and
          college I had earned quite a reputation as an orator. A possibly well
          meaning middle aged member from an audience once told me &quot;You are
          a dangerous person. People listen to you. You are wasting your time.
          You must join politics but Alas! I know my words will fall in deaf
          ears for you will only listen to Him&quot;. How I laughed!
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We know a car cannot run on mere reputation. It needs fuel. So I am
          preparing and rehearsing every detail of my talk. The storyline, the
          content, My clothes, My shoes, I know exactly what I want to wear and
          where I&apos;d pick it up from. I don&apos;t know why but I had this
          sudden urge to wear a watch. Because I never bothered to own one, I
          had to borrow. I&apos;m reviewing my talk on call, I&apos;m inviting
          my friends over for rehearsals. I&apos;m having unsettling performance
          anxiety so I&apos;m also smoking twice the usual cigarettes. I catch a
          terrible cold and cough and with just two days to go for my talk, she
          decides to break-up. Those days I used to be a very emotionally
          delicate and sensitive person. I didn&apos;t even have my presentation
          in order. As any responsible guy on the cusp of a breakthrough
          opportunity should, I placed myself together, worked on my
          presentation, continue my rehearsals right? Wrong. I did none of
          those. Instead, I chose to drink till 4:00 am. After reaching the
          venue, to make things exponentially worse, I see her walking around.
          For some reason, she chooses to ignore the fact that I am a guest
          speaker at the event and misbehaves with me in front of the other
          guests. I invite a friend over to help me with the presentation and
          even at last minute&apos;s notice, like an angel, she quickly drops by
          and just in a few minutes, has my presentation in order. With an
          awfully broken heart, a presentation that was prepared minutes ago,
          and totally nervous and dejected, I walk on stage. I don&apos;t know
          what happens to me when I walk on the stage. Something takes over me,
          words flow and the talk just happens.

          As luck may have it, my TEDx talk goes on to become one of the most
          widely watched talks on education globally and little did I know what
          life had in store for me. I was suddenly being invited for talks all
          over the country with so many questions being thrown at me in
          anticipation of answers but there was one problem. I had no answers! I
          wasn&apos;t in the best of shape and had a whole lot of unanswered
          questions myself so I found it incredibly ridiculous that I could go
          around passing any wisdom. By then my TEDx talk and the book in itself
          became a movement - A movement to transform the global education
          system. I started receiving multiple emails on my website. My TEDx
          talk started having thousands of comments and I was set out to take
          all these enraged people with me to change the education system of the
          world but then something totally unexpected happened. I walked into my
          own death…
